## Busy Bites

Busy Bites is a food connection app designed to help students create healthy meal plans, even with busy schedules and limited cooking experience. The app promotes nutritious choices as an alternative to fast food.

## Motivation

Our research reveals that many BCIT students struggle to maintain healthy eating habits as a result of their demanding academic schedules. To address this challenge, the Busy Bites team has developed a solution that facilitates both nutritious meal planning and the development of trust-based connections within the student community.

The Busy Bites app provides students with a map-based interface, detailing the location of nearby cooks, available menus, and meal pickup windows. Upon reserving a meal, the app conveniently notifies students of the approximate pickup time.

Busy Bites aims to reduce the burden of meal preparation and promote affordability by offering BCIT students one free, nutritious meal daily. In recognition of the generosity of individuals who share their cooking, we offer gift cards and fresh vegetables as tokens of our appreciation.
